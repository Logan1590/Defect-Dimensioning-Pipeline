Below is a list of scripts and their purposes:

-pose_estimation_v11/pose_estimation_v12.py:
  -Finds the 6D pose of an object in an image
-ML_Segmentation_v25.py: 
  -Extract 2D coordinates for feature points (geometric corners) of object in image
-Inference_v4_5.py
  -Applies trained machine model to segment defects
-visibility_utils_v4.py:
  -Stores functions used during mesh projection 
-Calibration_and_Annotation_v20.py:
  -Dimensions defects given a segmentation mask
-Camera_Distortion_v4.py: 
  -Finds camera matrix and distortion coefficients; stores camera calibration
-Keypoint_Mapping_Toy_List_Centered_Test2.json
  -Stores 2D-3D mapping for the test object
-Image_Comparison_v2.py: 
  -Segments defects by comparing two images (finds absolute difference and cleans anomalous differences with morphological operations)
-Model-Based_Defect_Segmentation_v5.5py:
  -Renders a 2D projection of a textured CAD model
-SampleCAD3.sldprt: Solidworks part file for the test object
